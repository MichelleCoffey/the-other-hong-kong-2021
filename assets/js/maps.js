  content: `<h4>Victoria Peak</h4>
  <p>A must-see spot in Hong Kong, The Peak is very popular thanks to its epic views of Victoria Harbour
   and the city itself. The easiest way to explore The Peak – other than visiting the lookout – is to take 
   an easy-going hour-long walk around the Peak. The walk is flat and accessible by baby strollers too. 
   You may also want to visit in the evening to view Hong Kong’s iconic skyline at night.   </p>`},
