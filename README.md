 ### Photo story for first time user

 ![The Other Hong Kong homepage on mobile, ipad, ipad pro and desk top.](images/homepage.png) "A Moveable Feast on multiple displays"
  The user will find images of the city, food and market dining options. There is also an easy to use navbar that links easily to the gallery, dining option informationa and finally the contact section. The landing page also explains the idea behind the website and the idea of making it easier to intruducing new food to tourists living in Shanghai. Due to Covid many people are concerned over eating in public or especially dining out with strangers. This alsert is hopefully temporary but guides the user to QR codes that help register the health info of the user but also an account for further information. 

 ![A pdf with Covid19 information and city QR codes.](images/covid19.png) "Covid19 safety information PDF"

  In this time of Covid19, the user will find an alert regarding practices and safety measures. 
  This links to a pdf with two QR codes. One QR code is for the WECHAT account and gives the user 
  the oppourtunity to contact A Moveable Feast regarding concerns about dining out. The second is 
  QR for registering your Health status as required by Shanghai Municipality and restaurants.
  The alert can also be removed and does not affect the site, when things change for the better.

# Design 
  ## Color Scheme  
  * Three main colors where chosen. Two were blue hues while the final is a white background. This a food based website, 
     so the added effect of text and images on a white background was to give  the illusion of  menu. The color was also inspired by the logo itself.  
     Colors are #13baec, white,  and #1339e4.
 ## Typography 
    
  * Font used is Montserrat. It has a long history, is easy to read and suits the concept of a food website. Sans Serif should be the fall back font as is the industry standard and is compatible on most devices. 
 ## Imagery
  * Images used were some of my own and also stock images taken from unsplash. The images were used to first engage with the food images and then with those who participate in the events and finally with the different types of restaurtant. 
    Images must depict diverse tastes and interests in order to attract a many and varied crowd. 
  
## Features
* Responsive on all devices and have interactive elements for bookings. Icons that link to further social media updates.

## Wireframes

* Wireframe for the whole project. [View](wireframe/amf.pdf)

### Bugs
#### Gallery

1. 
2. 
3. 
#### Navbar
* Because the logo was designed on Wix and was white, I had to target the color because bootstrap overrides the border color. 
  I did this by making the navbar background-color white in the style sheet. 
 #### Form 
 * This was the most difficult to control but by making the margin: auto it became responsive and also by adding d-flex from bootstrap.
