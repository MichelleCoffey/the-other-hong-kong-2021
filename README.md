# Design 
  ## Color Scheme  
  * Three main colors where chosen. These colours were inspired by the image of the sun setting over Hong Kong. The main colour is that of pink salmon
     Colors are #13baec, white,  and #1339e4.
 ## Typography 
    
  * Font used is Montserrat. It has a long history, is easy to read and suits the concept of a food website. Sans Serif should be the fall back font as is the industry standard and is compatible on most devices. 
 ## Imagery
  * Images used were some of my own and also stock images taken from unsplash. The images were used to first engage with the food images and then with those who participate in the events and finally with the different types of restaurtant. 
    Images must depict diverse tastes and interests in order to attract a many and varied crowd. 
  
## Features
* Responsive on all devices and have interactive elements for bookings. Icons that link to further social media updates.

## Wireframes

### Bugs
#### Gallery

1. 
2. 
3. 
#### Navbar
* Because the logo was designed on Wix and was white, I had to target the color because bootstrap overrides the border color. 
  I did this by making the navbar background-color white in the style sheet. 
 #### Form 
 * This was the most difficult to control but by making the margin: auto it became responsive and also by adding d-flex from bootstrap.
