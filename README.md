## User Experience (UX)
User Stories 

 
 1. First Time Visitor Goals
    a. First time visitors should be able to clearly access all links that inform the user of places to go in Hong Kong for hikes, that give impresseive views of the equally impressive city. While Hong Kong may be famous for its shopping, it can also attract those who enjoy impress views while on tough hikes. 
      
        
    b. The colours are attractive to the eye and lead the user down the page with the subtle colours that connect the different questions. An orange sun setting over a concrete gray Hong Kong.
    The Navbar in bright burnt orange with text in grey leads the readerâ€™s gaze down through the page and the image of a hiker perched atop a ridge looking down on the concrete jungle below. This is the opposite view of hong kong that people are used to seeing. It is usually a port view of Hong Kong taken from Kowloon. Next section provides the active links that introduces the new Hong Kong on google maps. A sign up sheet is a available to allow users to receive updates on locally organised group events. Finally, the footer links to the many social media accounts that will provide further updates for the Other Hong Kong. 

        
    c. Clicking either the home page or the company logo the user will find themselves on the main landing page. 

    d. The Explore button in the navbar leads the user to main interactive component of the site. My clicking hikes, markers for five different hikes in hong kong will appear with details regarding difficulty and length of hike. 

    e. Contact will allow the user to get info to any further details about locally organised group hikes in and around Hong Kong.

#### Setting up a google maps javascript API.

  ### Creating a project
1. To use Google Maps Platform, you must have a project to manage       services, credentials, billing, APIs, and SDKs.

2. Billing setup is required for each project, but you will only be charged if a project exceeds its free quota.

3. To create a Cloud project with billing enabled:
   Create a new Google Cloud project in the Cloud Console:

    - Create new project

    - On the New Project page, fill in the required information:

    - Project name: Accept the default or enter a customized name.

    - You can change the project name at any time. For more information, see Identifying projects.

    - Project ID: Accept the default or click EDIT to enter a customized ID that Google APIs use as a unique identifier for your project.

    - After you create the project, you cannot change the project ID, so choose an ID that you'll be comfortable using for the lifetime of the project. Don't include any sensitive information in your project ID.

    - Billing account: Select a billing account for the project. If you haven't set up a billing account or only have one billing account, you won't see this option.

    - You must be a Billing Account Administrator or Project Billing Manager to associate a project with a billing account. For more information, see the billing access control documentation.

    - Location: If you have an organization you want to link your project to, click Browse and select it; otherwise, choose "No organization".

### Enabling billing
1. To deploy your apps, you must enable billing. Your account will   not be charged if you stay within your free quota. If your application needs resources that exceed the free quota, you will be charged for the additional usage.

  2.  If you have a billing account when you create a Cloud project, then billing is automatically enabled on that project.

  3.  To enable billing on a Cloud project:

   - In the Cloud Console, go to the Billing page:

   - Go to the Billing page

  - Select or create a Cloud  project.

  -  Depending on if a billing account exists or if the selected Cloud project is associated with an account, the Billing page displays one of the following:

  -  If billing is already enabled for the selected Cloud project, then the details about the billing account are listed.

  -  If no billing account exists, you are prompted to create a billing account and associate it with the selected Cloud project.

  -  If a billing account exists, you are prompted to enable billing if the selected Cloud project is not already associated with a billing account. You can also click Cancel and then click Create account to create and associate a new billing account.

- After you enable billing, there is no limit to the amount that you might be charged. To gain more control over your costs, you can create a budget and set alerts. For more information, see Billing.

### Creating API keys
1. The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

2. To create an API key:

3. Go to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page.

4. Go to the Credentials page

5. On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.
The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
Click Close.
The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.
(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)

### Restricting API keys
1. Restricting API keys adds security to your application by ensuring only authorized requests are made with your API key. We strongly recommend that you follow the instructions to set restrictions for your API keys. For more information, see API security best practices.

2. To restrict an API key:

3. Go to the Google Maps Platform > Credentials page.

4. Go to the Credentials page

- Select the API key that you want to set a restriction on. The API key property page appears.
- Under Key restrictions, set the following restrictions:
Application restrictions:
To accept requests from the list of website that you supply, select HTTP referrers (web sites) from the list of Application restrictions.
Specify one or more referrer web sites. For example, *.google.com accepts all sites ending in google.com, such as https://developers.google.com.
Note: file:// referers need a special representation to be added to the key restriction. The "file://" part should be replaced with "__file_url__" before being added to the key restriction. For example, "file:///path/to/" should be formatted as "__file_url__//path/to/*". After enabling file:// referers, it is recommended you regularly check your usage, to make sure it matches your expectations.

4. API restrictions:
Click Restrict key.
Select Maps JavaScript API from Select APIs dropdown. If the Maps JavaScript API is not listed, you need to enable it.
If your project uses Places Library, also select Places API. Similarly, if your project uses other services in the JavaScript API (Directions Service, Distance Matrix Service, Elevation Service, and/or Geocoding Service), you must also enable and select the corresponding API in this list.
5. To finalize your changes, click Save.

### Adding the API key to your request
- You must include an API key with every Maps JavaScript API request. In the following example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.

### Bugs
#### Gallery

1. 
2. 
3. 
#### Navbar
* Because the logo was designed on Wix and was white, I had to target the color because bootstrap overrides the border color. 
  I did this by making the navbar background-color white in the style sheet. 
 #### Form 
 * This was the most difficult to control but by making the margin: auto it became responsive and also by adding d-flex from bootstrap.
